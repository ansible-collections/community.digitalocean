bugfixes:
  - The C(project_name) parameter for many modules was used by alias C(project) internally in the 
    codebase, but to work properly C(project_name) must be used in the code. Replace 
    self.module.params.get("project") with self.module.params.get("project_name")  
    (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.digitalocean/issues/326).
